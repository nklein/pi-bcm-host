# Common Lisp CFFI bindings for Raspberry Pi BCM-HOST Library

The Raspberry Pi BCM-HOST library is a small library used to interact
with the Broadcomm chips on-board.  This Common Lisp wrapper for that
library (currently) provides only the functions needed to re-implement
the raspistillyuv(1) program.
